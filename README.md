# Data-Preparation Project
Download the csv file. The csv file is the data which i have used to train and test my model. 
Run the program file in R-Studios.
I have used 3 algorithms namely neural networks, logistic regression and random forest.
Since the random forest produced high accuracy when compared to other models i oversampled the data and implemented only for random forest and got the accuracy of 94%.
